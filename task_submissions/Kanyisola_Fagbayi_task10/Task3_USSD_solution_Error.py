# This is a simulated USSD menu interaction for a mobile clinic. 
# The products aim is to make maternal healthcare accessible to expectant mothers in rural areas without smartphones. 
# The end goal is to reduce maternal mortality rate in underserved regions in Nigeria.
# Grant users access to medical personnels. 
# No doubt there are a lot of infrastructure, that the govt needs to put in place but this simply a logic.
# Please use the prescribed prompts commented on each block.
# I have used break to stop the inputs that aren't prescribed. 
# I really enjoyed this....To be continued. #KanyisolaTheIncomingTechSisInshaAllah
